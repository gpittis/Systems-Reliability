## Computational Work : AEOLUS Satellite Analysis  

This computational work focuses on the **AEOLUS satellite**, which is used for **weather prediction**. The study is conducted using **OMERE v4.0**, a radiation analysis and simulation software, to assess the satellite's exposure to space radiation and its impact on electronic components.  

### Electronic Components Under Study  
The following components were analyzed for radiation-induced failures:  
1. **Flash Memory (Micron MT29F32G08ABAAA)**  
   - Page program failure  
   - Device loss of functionality  
2. **Microcontroller (MSP430FR5969-SP)**  
   - SEU error detected  
   - Microcontroller reset due to SEFI
3. **SRAM Memory (Atmel M65608E)**  
   - Single Event Upset (SEU)
